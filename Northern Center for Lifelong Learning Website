Just adding that I also maintain the website for the Northern Center for Lifelong Learning (NCLL), you can find their website here:

https://www.nmu.edu/ncll/

They wanted it a certain way, so I kept to their vision of the website and their brand. But I also keep most of the data up-to-date, but the chairman sometimes does go in and 
change the "Program Feature" section.

I volunteer an hour or two a week to work on their website, and also meet with their chairmen once a week.
