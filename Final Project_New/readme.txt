BUGS: ****these are all of the known bugs so far****
  - the message sent to the user who's appointment has been accepted or declined doesn't go away after they have logged in multiple times
    - this is more of a weird "feature" that i don't like than a bug though

TODO: ****don't add anymore features****
  - when a user logs on, all of their previous appointments will be listed under the appointment application
      - i'd like to show their accepted and declined appointments as well, but not needed
      - accepted appointments will be green
      - declined appointments will be red
      - pending appointments will be gray or no color at all
  - able to click on one of your pending appointments and edit that specific appointment
